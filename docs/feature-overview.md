# Feature Overview

This is a high-level list of the possible features. It is highly subject to change.

- An HTTP server: This handles incoming HTTP requests and sends responses to the client.

- A router: This maps incoming requests to the appropriate handlers based on the URL and HTTP method.

- Handlers: These handle specific routes and perform the necessary actions, such as querying the database or rendering a template.

- A PostgreSQL database: This stores the application's data and allows the handlers to query and manipulate it.

- ORM(Object-relational mapping) or Database driver: This provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the database, allowing the handlers to work with objects instead of raw SQL.

- Templates: These are used to generate the HTML for the application's views.

- Middlewares: Additional functionality that can be added to the request/response chain to perform tasks like logging, authentication, and rate limiting.

- Dependency management: Go uses a package manager called go mod to manage the dependencies of the application.

- Caching: This can be used to speed up the application by storing frequently-used data in memory so that it doesn't need to be retrieved from the database each time it's needed. This can be achieved using in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached.

- Load balancer: This distributes incoming requests among multiple servers to ensure that the application can handle a high volume of traffic. This is particularly important for applications that expect to receive a lot of traffic or need to be highly available.

- Message queue: This allows different parts of the application to communicate asynchronously, by sending messages to a queue which are processed by a separate component. This can be used to decouple different parts of the application, and ensure that they can continue to work even if one part is temporarily unavailable.

- Reverse proxy: This could be used to terminate SSL connections and handle routing, authentication, and other functionality that would otherwise be handled by the application server.

- Monitoring and logging: This could be used to monitor application performance and troubleshoot issues. It provides metrics, traces, logs and events for the application for troubleshoot and analysis.
